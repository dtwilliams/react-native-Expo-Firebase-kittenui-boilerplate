Add your own Firebase, Facebook and Twitter configs to app.json

TODO:
- react-native-simple-twitter needs patching to use the latest version of react-native-webview
  - perhaps create own modal component to handle twitter login

- find way to merge firebase users so can login using whatever social login user prefers.
